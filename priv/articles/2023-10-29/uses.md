Inspired by [Andrea Leopardi](https://andrealeopardi.com/uses/), I put together a list of the hardware and software I use in my day-to-day work.

## Hardware
My daily-driver is a Dell XPS 13 (12th Gen i7, 32GB, 1TB.)

Connected to my laptop via USB-C, is a Dell 34" Widescreen (3440 x 1440.)

I use the Logitech MX Keys and MX Master 3 for bluetooth input.

And for the plethora of Zoom meetings, I use a Sony Alpha 6100 mirrorless camera.

## Software
My operating system is Ubuntu Linux.

I have tried out other distros, and have used MacOS in the past, but I switched around 5 years ago to Linux and have found Ubuntu the easiest to use and most reliable. In addition, Dell sells a Developer Edition XPS that comes with it pre-installed.

For writing code, I started out using BBEdit, then moved to TextMate around 2006. I held out as long as I could and eventually switched to Atom and then VS Code, which I have used exclusively for the last few years.

And, my preferred browser is Firefox.

## Other
To organize myself and generally noodle on ideas, I use a dot-ruled Moleskine and a Kuru Toga. If you have never tried that pencil, I strongly recommend getting one. They are affordable and simply the best tool for the job.
